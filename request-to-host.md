# Hosting SeattleJS

SeattleJS often relies on local Seattle tech companies to act as a host for our events. It's an excellent opportunity to engage with some of the brightest web developers in Seattle and give back to the developer community.

In order to be a host, you must be able to provide:

* Seating for 50+
* Good and accessible Wi-Fi
* Ability to project (audio input also helps)

You can check out our Meetup page and see which of our upcoming meetups does not currently have a venue. If you're interested in hosting, just follow these directions.

## Submitting a Hosting Request

We use Github issues to manage requests to host. Just click on the issues icon on the sidebar to get started:
